/*
Windowing is a kind of optimization that is used when party A needs to send some
value y over to party B, and then party B needs to compute all powers
(y, y^2, y^3, ... y^m), but multiplications are more expensive for B than for A.

The basic idea is that A can compute some, but not all powers of y, choosing
them strategically to minimize the number of multiplications that B will have
to perform.

This class implements a windowing optimization described in [CLR17] that is
parametrized over a window size l and maximum power m, and requires A to send
over the values y^{2^{l * i} * j} for each 0 <= i <= ceil(log2(m) / l) and
1 <= j <= 2^l - 1.

Additionally, we implement the special case l = 0 that does not use windowing
and only sends over y.
